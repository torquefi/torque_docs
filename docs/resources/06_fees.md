# Fees

## About

Torque fees are subject to change based on governance vote. Fees bolster treasury growth, support community initiatives, and provide runway for design/development.

## Performance

When it comes to [Boost](https://app.torque.fi/boost), profits are split 80/20 between depositors and the treasury. When it comes to [Borrow](https://app.torque.fi/borrow), there will be no profits until the end collateral (USDC) is made productive via governance vote. That means for the time being, reserves remain idle.

## Liquidation

When a loan position becomes underwater, where borrowed > LTV, some of the position's collateral may be seized in order protect Torque. There is a 10% penalty when a user is liquidated which is awarded to the liquidator. To avoid liquidation, please ensure your positions remain healthy by topping up collateral or paying down the loan amount.
