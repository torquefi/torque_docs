# What is Torque?

## Introduction

 Torque is an automation protocol to streamline saving while minimizing risk through dynamic routing. It unifies the finest, non-custodial yield and loan opportunities found on the blockchain to satisfy the key components of wealth generation while reducing friction, increasing transparency, and guaranteeing self-custody.

## tTokens

When a user creates a Boost vehicle,  `tTokens` are issued to represent the underlying claim. These initially map users 1:1 with their funds and are redeemable through the Torque dApp or by directly interacting with Torque smart contracts. The protocol enables diversified yield capture across DeFi's finest opportunities. Further use cases for `tTokens` may develop such as a lending market or other wealth management applications.
