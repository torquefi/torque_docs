# Currency Engines

Torque's engines are smart contracts powering the minting and burning of Torque currencies. Each engine is designed to manage a specific currency pair, ensuring stability through a collateralization mechanism, real-time price feeds, and dynamic risk parameters. The engines incorporate cross-chain capabilities, automated market making, and robust security features to maintain protocol integrity and user protection.
