# Torque Rewards

<div class="intro-description">
Torque implements a rewards system that creates natural value loops where TORQ is earned through real economic activity rather than artificial incentives. This makes TORQ a byproduct of useful actions, not a speculative asset, ensuring sustainable tokenomics and long-term ecosystem growth. Staking rewards are distributed based on protocol activity.
