# Import

## Summary

Import enables migration of loan positions from Aave and Radiant to Compound, allowing users to optimize their interest rates. When `torqRefinance` is called, collateral (such as WBTC or WETH) is fetched by repaying USDC or USDC.e and transferred into Compound, where the new position is created. Ultimately, users receive USDC back from Compound and  immediately benefit from a better rate, all while maintaining their collateral in a non-custodial environment.

## Compound V3

The integration of Compound V3 (Comet) with Torque streamlines the migration of loan positions from other DeFi platforms, such as Aave and Radiant. Users gain access to competitive loan rates and improved capital efficiency by migrating these loans into Compound via Torque. External incentives (such as TORQ and other rewards) continue to accrue.

## Conclusion

Import is designed to help users migrate their positions with ease, minimizing complexity and ensuring that their capital is always working at the optimal rate. By leveraging Torque's Automation, users can transition from high-interest loans on other platforms into more favorable conditions on Compound, reducing interest burden and maximizing their savings.
