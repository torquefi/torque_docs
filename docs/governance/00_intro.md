# Governance

Torque is governed and upgraded by tokenholders using three components:

1. TORQ token
2. Governor
3. Multisig

Together, these components enable the community to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the Torque system. Proposals can modify system parameters, activate or deactivate policies, and install or upgrade modules, effectively allowing the addition of new features and the mutation of the protocol.

## TORQ
TORQ, or Torque, is an ERC-20 token used for proposing upgrades to Torque protocol. TORQ can be obtained by trading for it on Uniswap (Arbitrum network). The use cases of TORQ today include voting and collateral at Ajna.

### Delegation
TORQ allows the owner to delegate voting rights to any address, including their own. There's a few considerations to keep in mind when delegating:

* Users can delegate to only one address at a time
* The entire TORQ balance of the delegator is added to the delegateeâ€™s vote count
* Changes to the delegator's token balance automatically adjust the voting rights of the delegatee
* Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the delegator delegates again or transfers

Delegation can be achieved by calling the `delegate()` function or via a valid off-chain signature using `delegateBySig()`. Torque provides a frontend for managing delegations [here](https://app.torque.fi/vote).
<!--  
:::info
You must delegate your TORQ in Cooler Loans to be eligible to vote in both Snapshot and Governor Bravo. Visit [Torque Govern](https://app.Torquedao.finance/#/governance) page for more information.

## Multisig
Multisigs perform protocol upgrades for roles that are not yet under Governor Bravo control. The multisigs queue and execute
on-chain actions that are approved by the community through [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/), an off-chain governance client. Today, the following roles are under multisig control:


| Role | Responsibility | Systems affected | Multisig |
|-------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| executor | Ability to install modules and policies on Kernel | Kernel | DAO MS |
| admin | Assign roles to any policy | Kernel | DAO MS |
| price_admin | Calculates price metrics to use for RBS | RBS | DAO MS |
| heart_admin | Manages heartbeats | RBS | DAO MS |
| operator_admin | Initialize RBS operator | RBS | DAO MS |
| operator_reporter | Records a bond purchase and updates capacity accordingly. Limited to the `BondCallback` contract. | RBS | DAO MS
| operator_policy | Manages RBS ranges | RBS | DAO MS |
| callback_admin | Callback to interface with Bond system | RBS | DAO MS |
| heart_admin | Heart beat manager | RBS and Staking | DAO MS |

Per [OIP-152](https://forum.Torquedao.finance/d/4088-oip-152-on-chain-governance), additional roles will be transfered from multisig management to Governor Bravo. This phase is expected to complete by Q3 2024. -->
