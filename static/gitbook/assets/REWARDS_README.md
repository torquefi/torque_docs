# üîÑ Torque Rewards: Flow-Based Value Loops

## Overview

The Torque Rewards system has been completely redesigned to create **natural, flow-based value loops** where TORQ tokens are earned through real economic activity rather than artificial incentives. This makes TORQ a byproduct of useful actions, not a speculative asset.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**TORQ should feel automatic, not forced.** Users earn tokens by doing what they would naturally do in the Torque ecosystem:

- Trade FX ‚Üí Earn TORQ
- Process payments ‚Üí Earn TORQ  
- Provide liquidity ‚Üí Earn TORQ
- Stake for governance ‚Üí Earn TORQ
- Use cross-chain features ‚Üí Earn TORQ

## üèÜ Reward Categories

### 1. FX Trading Rewards (0.25% of volume)
**Natural Action:** Users trade FX pairs for profit
**TORQ Earned:** 0.25% of trade volume
**Why It Works:** Trading is the core use case - rewards feel organic

### 2. Payment Processing Rewards (0.1% of volume)
**Natural Action:** Users process payments through Torque
**TORQ Earned:** 0.1% of payment volume  
**Why It Works:** Payments are utility, not speculation

### 3. Liquidity Provision Rewards (0.5% of liquidity)
**Natural Action:** Users provide liquidity to enable trading
**TORQ Earned:** 0.5% of liquidity provided
**Why It Works:** Liquidity providers directly enable the ecosystem

### 4. Staking Rewards (1% of staked amount)
**Natural Action:** Users stake TORQ for governance rights
**TORQ Earned:** 1% of staked amount (scaled by lock duration)
**Why It Works:** Staking aligns user interests with protocol success

### 5. Cross-Chain Rewards (0.75% of volume)
**Natural Action:** Users bridge assets across chains
**TORQ Earned:** 0.75% of cross-chain volume
**Why It Works:** Cross-chain usage expands the ecosystem

### 6. Referral Rewards (2% of referred activity)
**Natural Action:** Users bring new participants to Torque
**TORQ Earned:** 2% of referred user's activity
**Why It Works:** Organic growth through user networks

### 7. Volume Bonus Rewards (0.05% bonus)
**Natural Action:** High-volume users get bonus rewards

## üèÖ Volume Tiers & Multipliers

The system includes volume-based tiers that provide multipliers on all rewards:

| Tier | Volume Requirement | Multiplier | Benefits |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Bronze | $0+ | 1.0x | Base rewards |
| Silver | $10k+ | 1.25x | 25% bonus on all rewards |
| Gold | $100k+ | 1.5x | 50% bonus on all rewards |
| Platinum | $1M+ | 2.0x | 100% bonus on all rewards |
| Diamond | $10M+ | 3.0x | 200% bonus on all rewards |

## üìä Activity Scoring System

Users build an "Activity Score" (0-1000) based on their engagement:

- **Liquidity Provision:** +15 points (highest value)
- **Cross-Chain Operations:** +12 points  
- **FX Trading:** +10 points
- **Staking:** +8 points
- **Payment Processing:** +5 points
- **Referrals:** +3 points

### Activity Score Bonuses:
- **800+ Score:** +0.5% bonus on all rewards
- **600+ Score:** +0.3% bonus on all rewards
- **400+ Score:** +0.15% bonus on all rewards
- **200+ Score:** +0.05% bonus on all rewards

**Activity scores decay over time** to encourage consistent engagement.

## üîÑ Value Loop Examples

### Example 1: FX Trader Journey
1. **User trades $10,000 in EUR/USD**
   - Earns 25 TORQ (0.25% of volume)
   - Gains +10 activity score
   - Builds volume toward Silver tier

2. **User reaches Silver tier ($10k volume)**
   - All future rewards get 1.25x multiplier
   - Next $10k trade earns 31.25 TORQ instead of 25

3. **User stakes earned TORQ for governance**
   - Earns additional staking rewards
   - Gains voting power in protocol decisions
   - Further increases activity score

### Example 2: Liquidity Provider Journey
1. **User provides $50,000 in liquidity**
   - Earns 250 TORQ (0.5% of liquidity)
   - Gains +15 activity score (highest)
   - Immediately qualifies for Silver tier

2. **High activity score provides bonuses**
   - 600+ score gives +0.3% bonus
   - Total reward: 250 + 0.75 = 250.75 TORQ

3. **User becomes a power user**
   - Qualifies for Gold tier ($100k volume)
   - All rewards get 1.5x multiplier
   - Becomes a key ecosystem participant
